Parametric System Instructions - Build Anying 





Introduction :




Imagine a magic terminal which took in configurable codes (which obeyed system schemas) and generated system files, directories and resources which would give the user the things to build and assemble it.


Imagine a script enviornment with those same codes could be named and called as object and put into an asse,bly
What is it ?


python or scad Script -> Parameterize -> Certify


Scripting

Parametrizing

Certifying

This involves defining a hardware schema. There are two requirements for creating a new hardware schema :



Encoding
User selects system provided choices of hardware family, type and parameters. (Which were already programmed in scad) - > Schema/Code -> Represent a mapping to a particular function.
Decoding
If an assembly is defined then that assembly can be parametrized and certified.

Hardware Codes
    Family Codes
    Type Codes
        In general there is a scad module for each type.
        The parameter count may vary from type tyo type but not within type. This could be easily overridden but it may just get confusing.
    Paramater Codes
Hardware Sets
    Any hardware codethat is not completely specified s a hardware set since it includes a alist of possible hardware elements.
