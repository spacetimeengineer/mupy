For example :

    Ïˆ:# CUBX0006-BLK-L1000W200H15

would materialize a board object of length 100mm, a width of 200mm and a height of 15mm. 




Hardware Codes
    Family Codes
    Type Codes
        In general there is a scad module for each type.
        The parameter count may vary from type tyo type but not within type. This could be easily overridden but it may just get confusing.
    Paramater Codes
Hardware Sets
    Any hardware codethat is not completely specified s a hardware set since it includes a alist of possible hardware elements.
