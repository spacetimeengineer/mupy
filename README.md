### Project : PSI ( Parametric System Instructions )

PSI : System Decoder / System Encoder / System Simulator / System Certifier / Feature Ingestor


In a nutshell PSI is a python3 package which bundles two main functions :
1.) PSI takes in 'hardware-codes' or more generally 'system-codes' and spits out STL files / resources for 3D print / total assemb;y manufacturing or other manufacturing. These codes do not exist in a database, insteaad they map to paramaters for open scad functions. ; PSI is an abstraction. 
2.) PSI library provides a workbench simulation library which contains functionality used for designing large advanced and coordinated systems. It is believed that such a tool would be required for a population to advance themselves technologically without the guide of governmentsor large companies.
