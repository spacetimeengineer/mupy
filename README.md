What is PSI?

    PSI is an acronym which for Parametric Systems Interface. It is an extremely extensive and powerful utility which will be used for building physical thingsof arbitrary size and complexity.

How does it work?

    Its difficult to explain because its a little too simple. For starters it is a python pip package and it contains two essential ways of interfacing with it:

        PSI Terminal  For handling non-automatable user input.
        PSI Scriting  For everythong that is automatable.

Who is it for?

    If you are an inventor, artist, engineer, maker or dreamer this is for you. If your a dad and you want to make toys for your kid, this is for you.
