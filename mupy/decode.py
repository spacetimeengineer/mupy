"""
This class is one of the worst parts of this whole project. 
The reason for it's existence was that there needed to be a place to make function calls for various scad libraries.
It sucks because certification implies based on this structure that we need to inject a new directory for each family code.
At first this seems reasonable but when you consider automating certification to the point where you can make a new family for a trivial assembly, it would be hard to program so many more directories.
I Think there needs to exist a 3rd part database or online marketplace or archive where the code is stored.
